Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\n\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\n\n.. topic:: References\n\n   - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\n     Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\n     Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\n   - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

This exercise is aimed \\n   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\\n\\nI agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is\\nnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.\\n\\n   [snip]\\n   imagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\n   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\n   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\n\\nI would not argue that all or even most of the villages are \"terrorist\\ncamps\".  There are however some which come very close to serving that\\npurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way\\nprior to the invasion. \\n\\n   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\n   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\\n\\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\\n\\n--\\nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\\nOS Software Engineer    |\\nThinking Machines Corp. |\\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.\\nCambridge, MA           |\\n', 'From: noye@midway.uchicago.edu (vera shanti noyes)\\nSubject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity\\nReply-To: noye@midway.uchicago.edu\\nOrganization: University of Chicago\\nLines: 56\\n\\nIn article <May.11.02.39.05.1993.28328@athos.rutgers.edu> carlson@ab24.larc.nasa.gov (Ann Carlson) writes:\\n\\n[bible verses ag./ used ag. homosexuality deleted]\\n\\n>Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should \\n>check out Dignity, Integrity, More Light Presbyterian churches, Affirmation,\\n>MCC churches, etc.  Meet some gay Christians, find out who they are, pray\\n>with them, discuss scripture with them, and only *then* form your opinion.\\n\\nalso check out the episcopal church -- although by no means all\\nepiscopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women, there\\ncertainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are.  i\\nam good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and\\nliving in a monogamous homosexual relationship.  this in no way\\ndiminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very\\nsignificant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his\\ncommunity, as well as a very significant aids ministry.\\n\\nmy uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think\\nabout what the bible has to say about this and what i feel God thinks\\nabout this.  obviously my conclusions may be wrong; nonetheless they\\nare my own and they feel right to me.  i believe that the one\\nimportant thing that those who wrote the old and new testament\\npassages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific\\nevidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly _inherent_\\nrather than completely learned.  this means that to a certain extent\\n-- or to a great extent -- homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about\\nother people -- which is why reports of \"curing\" homosexuals always\\nchill me and make me feel ill.  please not that, although i can\\'t cite\\nsources where you can find this information, there is homosexual\\nbehavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself\\nsuggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that\\nthe word \"unnatural\" shouldn\\'t really apply....\\n\\nplease remember that whatever you believe, gays and lesbians shoul not\\nbe excluded from your love and acceptance.  christ loved us all, and\\nwe ALL sin.  and he himself never said anything against homosexuals --\\nrather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as\\n\"women shouldn\\'t speak in church\" and \"women should keep their heads\\ncovered in church\" -- not exact quotations as i don\\'t have my bible\\nhandy) who says these things.  i have a tendency to take some of the\\nthings paul says with a grain of salt....\\n\\nwell, that\\'s all i\\'ll say for now.\\n\\n>*************************************************      \\n>*Dr. Ann B.
